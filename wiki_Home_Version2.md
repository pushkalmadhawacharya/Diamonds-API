# Diamond Game Rules

- 4 suits: Hearts, Spades, Clubs, Diamonds (Diamonds are the trump)
- Each player gets a full suit except Diamonds (which are won by bidding)
- Each round, a Diamond card is up for bid; players bid with a card from their hand (1 per suit)
- Denotion on the cards represents the points (A=1, J=11, Q=12, K=13) 
- Highest value wins the Diamond card and its points 
- Game continues until all Diamond cards are won
- Winner is the player with most points at the end
